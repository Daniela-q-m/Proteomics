# Salts and protein solubility. Principle salting in/out

### Salting in:

* Solubility at low ionic strength increases with salt concentration.
* More counterions shield the proteinâ€™s charges + prevent aggregation

### Salting out:

* Solubility at high ionic strength decreases with salt concentration
* Competition between salt and protein for solvation


## Hofmeister Series
**Ions that increase solubilities also tend to denature proteins (chaotropic agents)**
  - I-, ClO4-, SCN-, Li+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Ba2+ - Urea, guanidium ion
**Ions that decrease solubility also stabilize their native structures *(Hofmeister series)* **
Order of effectiveness in salting out:
  *  **Anions:** SO24- > H2PO4- > CH3COO- > Br > CIO4- >SCN-
  *  **Cations:** NH4+, CS+, K+, Na+ > Li+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+, Ba2+


## Heat Denaturation


## Dialysis
A membrane with pores of a given size is used as a size cut-off filter.

## Affinity Chromatography

The basic principle is that a specific interaction between the column and one type of molecule in the mixture is used. This can be for example an antibody-antigen interaction (shown in the inset of the graph), or between a histidine tag and a Nickel column (where the Nickel gets chelated by the histidines), etc.

## Ion Exchange Chromatography 

The principle of ion exchange chromatography is based on electrostatic interaction between positive charges on the column and negative charges in the protein of interest (or vice versa).  

## Size Exclusion Chromatography

Principle of size exclusion chromatography, also referred to as gel filtration: Small samples can enter the pores of the column material and take longer to come back out than large molecules, especially if they are so large that they cannot enter into the porous material of the column at all.
**Result of Size Exclusion**

Example of elution of the same protein in different salt concentrations that affect its size. The x-axis shows the elution volume in milliliter and the scale on the top shows how the elution volume compares to molecular weight in kDa (kiloDaltons). This scale was obtained using standard samples with known molecular weights.

## HPLC
Many high pressure liquid chromatography or HPLC columns are using the so-called reverse phase principle. The stationary phase is the column and the mobile phase is a solvent.  

## SDS-PAGE

Sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS (see structure below), is a highly negatively charged detergent and is added to the samples and the running buffer. The gel is made out of polyacrylamide and is immersed in the running buffer. Samples are loaded in loading buffer and dye that interacts with proteins so that later we can visualize the proteins. The polyacrylamide is a mesh similar to the principle of gel filtration, where this time, small molecules can move faster and large molecules get stuck and migrate more slowly. The purpose of the SDS is to bind to the protein, denature it and make it negative. Then, voltage is applied and the negatively charged proteins will migrate towards the positively charged electrode. This process is called electrophoresis.

## Isoelectric focussing

Isoelectric focusing introduces a pH gradient which will allow separating proteins based on their net charge, given by how many positive and negative amino acids the protein displays on its surface (and what their respective pKa values are).

## Western Blot 
To unambiguously identify a protein, we use a highly specific interaction with antibodies. When this process is combined with SDS-PAGE or 2d gel elecrophoresis, we call this approach Western blot. In a Western Blot, we add one more step before visualization, namely the interaction with the antibody. We then visualize the antibody rather than the protein, so that we only get a band at the position of the antibody not any other proteins. 

## Quantification
To quantify how much protein we purified, we usually use absorbance spectroscopy, which allows you to accurately quantify the protein concentration using absorbance at 280 nm from aromatic amino acids in your protein, or you can add dyes to your sample to quantify such as Biorad, Bradfor or Lowry assays.
